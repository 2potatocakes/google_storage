<p>I wrote this gem because the only google storage gems I could find already written were either written a while ago and only set up to use the old
version of Google&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> or they were dependent on Gems that don&#8217;t run properly on&#8230; dare I say it&#8230; windows.. :)  Apologies, I&#8217;m without choice
at the moment, but anyways, this gem should run fine on all platforms and I&#8217;ve tried to keep dependencies to a minimum. Let me know if you find
any bugs though ok and feel free to contribute.</p>
<p>Google Storage is still a little experimental at the moment and the responses back from google differ quite a bit from each other.
I&#8217;ve tried to parse all of these different responses and turn them into a fairly common type of response object though.</p>
<h2>Setup Guide</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of steps to follow in order to setup this gem. The new Google Storage APIv2 uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate requests, you can read up
more on the nitty gritty if you like here: <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/OAuth2.html">Google&#8217;s OAuth2 Guide</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and add client side support also once this gem is up and running properly, but for the moment it&#8217;s only setup to support server side web
applications.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also possible to run this gem from the command line if you want.</p>
<h2>Install the google_storage Gem</h2>
<p>Include the google_storage gem in your Gemfile and install config files
<pre class="code"><span class='id gem'>gem</span> <span class='id “google_storage”'>“google_storage”</span>
<span class='id bundle'>bundle</span> <span class='id install'>install</span>
</pre>
Then in your Rails application directory run:
<pre class="code"><span class='id rails'>rails</span> <span class='id generate'>generate</span> <span class='label'>google_storage:</span><span class='id install'>install</span>
</pre>
This will generate some rake tasks a google_storage.yml file in your config directory.
<pre class="code"><span class='tstring'><span class='regexp_beg'>/</span><span class='tstring_content'>Application</span><span class='regexp_end'>/config</span></span><span class='op'>/</span><span class='id google_storage'>google_storage</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id yml'>yml</span>
<span class='tstring'><span class='regexp_beg'>/</span><span class='tstring_content'>Application</span><span class='regexp_end'>/lib</span></span><span class='op'>/</span><span class='id tasks'>tasks</span><span class='op'>/</span><span class='id google_storage'>google_storage</span><span class='period'>.</span><span class='id task'>task</span>
</pre></p>
<h2>Setup your Google Project Client ID&#8217;s</h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/storage/">Google Storage</a> and select activate Google Storage.
If you haven&#8217;t already got a project set up, it&#8217;ll prompt you to create one.</p>
<p>When you have access to your Google APIs Console, you need to enable Google Storage. When you select enable, you&#8217;ll be shown terms and conditions
and you&#8217;ll then need to setup billing. They have full pricing details there for you to check out as well but I think it&#8217;s pretty reasonable..</p>
<p>Create a client ID for your project
On the left menu select &#8220;<span class="caps">API</span> Access&#8221; and then &#8220;Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID&#8221;
Enter your project&#8217;s name and brand information.</p>
<p>Select Application type = Web Application and enter your site&#8217;s information. If you&#8217;re using localhost and running
locally make sure you include the port number you&#8217;re using as well.</p>
<h2>Enter your Client ID details into your google_storage.yml</h2>
<p>This is the example google_storage.yml file that is copied into your config directory of your rails application.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to obtain a refresh token from google.</p>
<pre class="code">
#Replace the following example ids with your own

google_config:
  x-goog-project-id: 825628431245

#Client ID for web applications
web_applications:
  client_id: 825628431245.apps.googleusercontent.com
  client_secret: lpNYX5SPFDB6N-40lyMIPlQn
  redirect_uris: 'http://localhost:3000/example'
  js_origins: 'http://localhost:3000'

#refresh_token: replace this line with a refresh token from google, read below on how to get one

#You need to acquire a refresh token from google so that the google_storage gem
#can acquire access tokens whenever it needs to make new requests

# 1. Make sure you've signed up for Google Storage and filled in the above client ID details
#    for your web application first
#
# 2. Depending on how much access you want to grant to your application run
#    ONE of the following from your applications root directory. If you intend to be able to create and
#    destroy objects and buckets and also be able to set permissions then use full_control
#
#           rake gs:grant:read_only
#           rake gs:grant:read_write
#           rake gs:grant:full_control
#
# 3. Step 2 will generate a URL for you. Copy and paste the URL into a browser and you should be prompted
#    by google to authorize the request by logging into your browser using the google email account you setup
#    your google storage account with
#
# 4. When you 'allow access' you'll be redirected back to the redirect URL you setup in your client ID
#    Your redirect URL should now include an authorization code. It'll look something like this:
#    http://localhost:3000/example?code=4/WvlklnjtybhRJpaKpmDYrzIhAzyx
#
# 5. Copy that code from your URL and run the following rake task from your application directory
#
#           rake gs:refresh_token['paste_your_auth_code_here']
#  Example: rake gs:refresh_token['4/WvlklnjtybhRJpaKpmDYrzIhAzyx']
#
# 6. If everything worked you should see something that looks like the following:
#
#           refresh_token: 1/x4X-U57snRMkLIWWYHWLCXPbfcnyGsdfx04sWAiG_1k
#
# 7. Copy and paste the refresh_token into this file. Your application should now be able to make calls to your
#    Google Storage API
</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve acquired your refresh_token you can now make calls to the <span class="caps">API</span>. Refer to the examples dir on how to use.</p></div></div>
